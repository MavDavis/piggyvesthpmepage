I joined piggyvest while doing my NYSC, I used my PPA allowance but saved my federal government allowance. What I saved, I used it as an independent lady to learn how to drive, apply for my master's program, rent a house in Abuja, and learn some skills. If you have the spirit of saving, you can actually save from any income/money and Piggyvest is there to help me hold it till I need it.

PiggyVest has helped me through my savings, last year I planned on saving some amount to use in December and PiggyVest made it easy for me to do so.
